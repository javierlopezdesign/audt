                        <p>FoxAuDT basicly is a tool to have a historical of the auditories carried out through the development or testing stage. As web/app developers we have faced some difficulties during the testing, some changes can leave bad performance
                            or issues without noticing it. Can you guess a CMS already deployed and the client upload huge images, or leave dead links, how that would represent on the SEO? AuDT store previous auditories, compare them and show you some
                            clues about where the site could have issues. It is based on the Google Dev tool, lighthouse running the lastest version.</p>
